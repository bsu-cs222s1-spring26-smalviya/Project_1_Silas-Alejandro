  It will be noted just in case, but there is an implementation in the build file to suppress a non-major(weak) warning. It was purely done for the output of the program, as it would break up the body of the oputput and make it look worse. Seemingly the warning itself had something to do with one of the libraries we needed to use to parse the JSON files to some extent, so I was not able to find and fix them, at the root cause. And so, I settled for the implementation in the build file to suppress the warning to some extent.
